MASA was invited to attend, in order to present its research program [TACTIC](https://masa-group.biz/projects/tactic/), a project that simplifies C2 (Command and Control) tactical systems by making them more accessible and by allowing for multimodal ergonomics, an easy-­to-­read interface, interoperability with C2 systems, and standardized exchanges.
