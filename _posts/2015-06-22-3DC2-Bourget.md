Together with Eyes3Shut and Télécom Bretagne, we presented a multiview collaborative system on the MINDEF (French MoD) stand during the Paris Air Show 2015. In order to demonstrate the DGA-funded 3DC2 project, Deev developed a custom demonstration application that allows cooperative UCAV mission planning with a four-views system (threats management, target planning, air operations and satellite imagery).
