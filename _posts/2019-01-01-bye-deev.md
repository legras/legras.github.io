Until 2018, I have been working within the framework of Deev Interaction SAS (a French kind of LLC) as president and sole employee. Recent changes have led me to reconsider this. Deev Interaction has been shut down, and I am now working as an independent expert/researcher.

This changes basically nohing for my clients, all assets and IP owned by Deev are now transferred to my name.

I will begin to migrate the content of the old site to this new one gradually.
