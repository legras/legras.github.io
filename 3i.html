<h1 class="header">Enabling Cooperation in UAV Systems</h1>

<p>From the point of view of its end-users, a drone is simply an Eye-in-the-Sky i.e. a flying platform equipped with a camera, that allows them to to see interesting things and places beyond their line of sight. From the point of view of Aviation Authorities, things are not so simple: usage of UAV (Uninhabited Air Vehicles) in the airspace is only beginning to get accepted and is closely controlled. The operators (the « pilots »), the airframes and the software must abide by regulations and be certified before being allowing flight and ultimately providing service as an Eye-in-the-Sky.

<p>The classical usage scenario of a mid-sized UAV system is to have two certified operators in charge of the system (a pilot operator and payload/camera operator) while the end-users somewhat manage to look over their shoulders to look at the data and express requests as they can (scribbling things on a map, pointing, shouting, etc.) There is obviously an opportunity to develop dedicated collaborative software (CSCW) to smooth this process, but modifying the control software implies to certify it all over again; a costly and long process. Therein lies a tension between satisfying the rapidly evolving needs of the end-users and the necessary cautiousness of regulations.

<p>In the framework of the Interreg IV A project 3i, Deev Interaction has developed together with Télécom Bretagne an innovative activity concept in order to alleviate this tension.

<p>In order to allow the end-users to send requests to the operators without modifying the certified control softwares of the drone, we make use of the ability of these software to receive data via network connections. In the following illustrations, software and other part of the system that are certified by Aviation Authorities are represented in green, while blue denotes parts of the system dedicated to the activity of the end-users.
